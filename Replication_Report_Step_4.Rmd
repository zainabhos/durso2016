##Introduction

I am interested in studying best practice approaches for designing and adapting educational spaces within emergency settings, e.g. war zones, refugee camps, natural disasters. Specifically, I study how exposure to such adversities can impact learning and whether pedagogical approaches can mitigate this impact. A common experience amongst populations who are impacted by emergencies is exposure to trauma, and a sequela of trauma is a sense of powerlessness. As such, this article’s focus on how perceptions of power can impact decisions regarding action vs. inaction seems interesting. A line of inquiry in my work is whether empowering adolescents and young adults in emergency contexts to bolster their agency in shaping their future can impact their learning and academic performance. How perceptions of power impact individuals’ predilections to act in ambivalent vs. univalent situations can have interesting implications for my population of interest. That is, will students who self-perceive as more powerful be less likely to make decisions regarding their academic effort when they feel ambivalent about the results of that effort? 

I also chose this experiment because I am interested in practicing the methodology that was used to analyze the results. While I have a theoretical understanding of the ANOVA test, I have seldom used it to analyze data firsthand. I hope to potentially use this approach in my own experimental designs in the future and would thus like to practice it using data from this replication study. 

To replicate this study, I will have to recruit 120 adults. Participants will randomly be assigned into 4 experimental groups using a 2x2 between-subject factorial design. That is, participants will be divided between an ambivalent vs. univalent x powerful vs. powerless group. Ambivalence vs. not will be measured through providing a case vignette through which Bob, a hypothetical employee, will be described with either all positive/ all negative attributes (univalent) or half positive half negative attributes. Participants will then be asked to choose whether they want to promote Bob. This measure of ambivalence is complemented by a measure of perceived power. Power will be measured by asking participants to respond to an ostensibly random essay question that purposefully inquires about a time they either felt powerful or powerless. This is a widely used measure of current perception of power. 
Participants will respond to the ambivalent assessment followed by the power assessment. Subsequently, participants will be asked how much they would like to wait before making a decision, and then be prompted to make a decision regarding promoting Bob. As such, procedures include reading a case vignette, writing a short paragraph, and responding to two questions. 

A pressing challenge will be recruiting participants who reflect the demographics of the original study. The original study did not include any information regarding the background of their participants other than their educational level, i.e. undergraduate students. I would be concerned about making a statement regarding the reproducibility—or lack thereof—of the original study when I don’t know whether my sample matches the original sample. This is especially because there can be disparate perceptions of power depending on gender, ethnicity, and race. A second challenging component will be surrounding the power measure. The first experiment does not include any self-report of power perceptions and assumes a higher power perception solely based on writing about feeling powerful. The second experiment, which is not included in this reproducibility study, inquires about the subjective power state, i.e. feeling powerful or not, through a self-report. This self-report would allow me to confirm whether participants’ results are in fact due to their subjective appraisal of their power as opposed to other confounding issues.

##Methods

###Power Analysis

The effect size for this study was calculated using the G*Power software. Because the original study used a MANOVA, the effect size was determined by taking the Pillai V value and determining the effect size ==> .0358

The original study notes that they aimed for 120 participants in order to stay within conventions of including 20-40 participants per cell in a 2x2 factorial design. In order to accomplish the effect size they saw, i.e. .0358, we need 274 participants for 80%, 358 for 90%, and 496 for 95% power. However, due to logistical limitations, this study will aim to recruit the original number of participants who took the study.

###Planned Sample

I will aim for 126 participants, and I will continue recruiting until that number is reached. Because authors seemed to be recruiting on an ongoing basis they stopped recruitment when they felt all 120 spots would be filled, but this recruitment will occur through a short period of time and will therefore continue until all 126 participants take the surveys. No preselction criteria or demographics indicated other than being an adult. However, in order to account for the difference sources in sampling, i.e. college campus in original study vs. Mturk in my study, I will incorporate a demographic variable to explore whether this poses a difference. 

###Materials

Prompts will be followed exactly.

###Procedure	

Exact procedure will be followed: 

"As a cover story, participants were first informed that
the study was being conducted with human-resourcesmanagement
researchers at the Fisher College of Business
at The Ohio State University. Participants were told that the
main goal was to understand how people make decisions
about employees. At this point, participants received information
that was ostensibly about an actual employee. This
information differed according to whether they were in the
ambivalent or in the univalent condition.
After reading the employee’s profile, participants were
assigned to the power induction, which involved the most
commonly used procedure for priming differences in perceived
power—writing about a previous episode in which
they had high or low power (Galinsky et al., 2003). Participants
were then asked to indicate the extent to which they
would prefer to wait to make a decision about the
employee (i.e., preference for inaction). Regardless of their
preference, they were subsequently prompted to make a
promote-or-not decision (Experiment 1) or a fire-or-not
decision (Experiment 2) about the employee, and the time
to make this decision was recorded."

The only difference will be in that participants will only be given the positive attributes of Bob as a univalent case, i.e. experiment 1, 
insteading of reading both positive and negative attributes. 

###Analysis Plan

1) Data exclusion: participants who fall within 6 SDs of response time will be excluded
2) Manipulation checks will be conducted to ensure that ambivalence and power are each measured only by their respective tests. This will be conducted through a 2x2 ANOVA to see whether factors other intended variables can predict differences. 
3) Multivariate analysis of inaction: responses will be put into a 2x2 ANOVA to assess main effects and interactions effects of employee profile and power state 
4) While not included in original study, I will look into education as a covariate  

Key analysis of interest will be a 2x2 between-subject factorial design - MANOVA

###Differences from Original Study

Two noteworthy differences exist: 

1) Participants in original study were recruited on a college campus and participated in study in person. This is in contrast to this replication study which will use an online platform and recruit participants from a variety of educational backgrounds, i.e. not all will be college students. I can include a question on my demographics survey to inquire about educational level, but even then geographic region of college could impact results.
2) Original study aggregated experiment 1 and 2 results into one design, which means they did not differentiate between negative and positive univalent prompts. I will only be including positive univalent scripts, though I don't think this will impact results because original study did not report significant differences between positive and negative scripts' impact on decision making process. Further, I will not be including self-report power measures as they were only included in experiment 2.

PilotB <- read.csv("/Users/Ikhlas/Desktop/Psych251/PilotBData.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
PilotB = PilotB[3:nrow(PilotB), ]
```

```{r}

#### Data exclusion / filtering

##Include only relevant columns 
Pilot <- subset(PilotB, select = c(Finished, Q15, Q16, Q6, Q10, Q8_Last.Click, Q8_Page.Submit, Q17, Ambivalentvs.Univalent_DO, Highvs.LowPower_DO, Q18, Q21, Q23))

##Include those who finished 
Pilot<-Pilot[!(Pilot$Finished=="False"),]


##Recode NAs
Pilot[Pilot==-99] <- NA

##Rename Columns 
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q6'] <- 'Verbal.Inaction'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q10'] <- 'Promote.Decision'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q8_Page.Submit'] <- 'Behavioral.Inaction'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q17'] <- 'Education'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Ambivalentvs.Univalent_DO'] <- 'Ambivalence.State'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Highvs.LowPower_DO'] <- 'Power.State'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q18'] <- 'MC1'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q21'] <- 'MC2'
names(Pilot)[names(Pilot) == 'Q23'] <- 'MC3'

## Variable cleaning - take the letters out of the variable values and change it to a numeric type
Pilot$Verbal.Inaction.Num = str_extract(Pilot$Verbal.Inaction, "[0-9]+")
Pilot$Verbal.Inaction.Num <- as.numeric(Pilot$Verbal.Inaction.Num)
Pilot$Behavioral.Inaction.Num <- as.numeric(Pilot$Behavioral.Inaction)


##Create composite score for ambivalence manipulation check 

Pilot$MC1 <- as.integer(Pilot$MC1)
Pilot$MC2 <- as.integer(Pilot$MC2)
Pilot$MC3 <- as.integer(Pilot$MC3)
Pilot$Subjective.Ambivalence<-rowMeans(Pilot[, c('MC1','MC2','MC3')], na.rm = TRUE)

##Assign Values 
    
Pilot[Pilot$Ambivalence.State == "Q14",]$Ambivalence.State = 1
Pilot[Pilot$Ambivalence.State == "Q13",]$Ambivalence.State = 0
Pilot[Pilot$Power.State == "Q15",]$Power.State = 1
Pilot[Pilot$Power.State == "Q16",]$Power.State = 0
Pilot[Pilot$Education == "True",]$Education = 1
Pilot[Pilot$Education == "False",]$Education = 0

##Change IVs to factors instead of characters 
Pilot$Ambivalence.State <- as.factor(Pilot$Ambivalence.State)
Pilot$Power.State <- as.factor(Pilot$Power.State)

##Exclusion criteria - folks within 6 median absolute deviation 

Pilot.Median.Stats = Pilot %>%
  summarize(Behavioral.Inaction.Num.M = median(Behavioral.Inaction.Num),
            Behavioral.Inaction.Num.MAD = median(abs(Behavioral.Inaction.Num-Behavioral.Inaction.Num.M)))

Pilot.Median.Stats

Pilot_filtered = Pilot %>%
  filter(abs(Behavioral.Inaction.Num-Pilot.Median.Stats$Behavioral.Inaction.Num.M) < 6 * Pilot.Median.Stats$Behavioral.Inaction.Num.MAD)

```

### Confirmatory analysis

1) Manipulation checks - Two way factorial design to assess whether variables other than intended one is responsible for differences, i.e. did reading ambivalent vs. univalent profiles determine ambivalence level or did other variable such as power impact it as well? This is to ensure that participants reading ambivalent scenarios are in fact becoming more ambivalent(?). 

##Manipulation Checks 

Code does not run because we don't have enough input yet. 

MC <- aov(Subjective.Ambivalence ~ Power.State*Ambivalence.State, data = Pilot)
summary(MC)

##Analysis of interest
2) Multivariate analysis of inaction - Two way factorial design to assess main effect of employee profile and significant interactions with power state 


```{r}
##MANOVA of Power state and ambivalence state as IVs and behavioral and verbal inaction as DVs

Result <- manova(cbind(Verbal.Inaction.Num, Behavioral.Inaction.Num) ~ Power.State*Ambivalence.State, data = Pilot_filtered)
summary(Result)

```

Note that the summary(fit1) function that should be after the above code doesn't work now because we don't have enough observations. When I try to run it it gives me this eror messages: Error in summary.manova(fit1) : residuals have rank 1 < 2. Could there be another reasong for this error?

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

```{r}
##Check whether college edcation impacts interaction 

Result1 <- manova(cbind(Verbal.Inaction.Num, Behavioral.Inaction.Num) ~ Power.State*Ambivalence.State*Education, data = Pilot_filtered)
summary(Result1)
```

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
