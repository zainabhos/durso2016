##Introduction

I am interested in studying best practice approaches for designing and adapting educational spaces within emergency settings, e.g. war zones, refugee camps, natural disasters. Specifically, I study how exposure to such adversities can impact learning and whether pedagogical approaches can mitigate this impact. A common experience amongst populations who are impacted by emergencies is exposure to trauma, and a sequela of trauma is a sense of powerlessness. As such, this article’s focus on how perceptions of power can impact decisions regarding action vs. inaction seems interesting. A line of inquiry in my work is whether empowering adolescents and young adults in emergency contexts to bolster their agency in shaping their future can impact their learning and academic performance. How perceptions of power impact individuals’ predilections to act in ambivalent vs. univalent situations can have interesting implications for my population of interest. That is, will students who self-perceive as more powerful be less likely to make decisions regarding their academic effort when they feel ambivalent about the results of that effort? 

I also chose this experiment because I am interested in practicing the methodology that was used to analyze the results. While I have a theoretical understanding of the ANOVA/MANOVA test, I have seldom used it to analyze data firsthand. I hope to potentially use this approach in my own experimental designs in the future and would thus like to practice it using data from this replication study. 

Informed by the original study, the independent variables (IVs) in my study will be ambivalence state (whether participants are made to feel ambivalent or univalent) and power state (whether participants feel powerful or not), and the dependent variable will be inaction, assessed through an objective measure (length of time participants take to make a decision) and subjective measure (length of time participants report needing to make a decision about Bob). 

RQ: Is there a main effect of ambivalence state, i.e. ambivalence means taking more time to decide, and is this main effect significantly impacted by an interaction with power state, i.e. ambivalence state is qualified by power state? 

To replicate this study, I will have to recruit 126 adults. Participants will randomly be assigned into 4 experimental groups using a 2x2 between-subject factorial design. That is, participants will be divided between an ambivalent vs. univalent x powerful vs. powerless group. Ambivalence vs. not will be measured through providing a case vignette through which Bob, a hypothetical employee, will be described with either all positive/ all negative attributes (univalent) or half positive half negative attributes. Participants will then be asked to choose whether they want to promote Bob. This measure of ambivalence is complemented by a measure of perceived power. Power will be measured by asking participants to respond to an ostensibly random essay question that purposefully inquires about a time they either felt powerful or powerless. This is a widely used measure of current perception of power. 
Participants will respond to the ambivalent assessment followed by the power assessment. Subsequently, participants will be asked how much they would like to wait before making a decision, and then be prompted to make a decision regarding promoting Bob. As such, procedures include reading a case vignette, writing a short paragraph, and responding to two questions. 

A pressing challenge will be recruiting participants who reflect the demographics of the original study. The original study did not include any information regarding the background of their participants other than their educational level, i.e. undergraduate students. I would be concerned about making a statement regarding the reproducibility—or lack thereof—of the original study when I don’t know whether my sample matches the original sample. This is especially because there can be disparate perceptions of power depending on gender, ethnicity, and race. A second challenging component will be surrounding the power measure. The first experiment does not include any self-report of power perceptions and assumes a higher power perception solely based on writing about feeling powerful. The second experiment, which is not included in this reproducibility study, inquires about the subjective power state, i.e. feeling powerful or not, through a self-report. This self-report would allow me to confirm whether participants’ results are in fact due to their subjective appraisal of their power as opposed to other confounding issues.

##Methods

###Power Analysis

The effect size for this study was calculated using the GPower software. Because the original study used a MANOVA, the effect size was determined by using the original study's data, accessed via the Open Science Framework (OSF.io). Using this data, the Pillai V. value for the interaction effect between ambivalence state (IV 1) and power state (IV 2) on the two measures of inaction (DV 1 and 2) was calculated as .0346, which allowed GPower to calculate an effect size based on the number of IVs and DVs. This effect size was determined to be .0358

The original study notes that they aimed for 120 participants in order to stay within conventions of including 20-40 participants per cell in a 2x2 factorial design. Due to the small effect size the authors found, i.e. .0358, we need 274 participants for 80%, 358 for 90%, and 496 for 95% power. However, due to logistical limitations, this study will aim to recruit the original number of participants who took the study, which is 126.

###Planned Sample

I will aim for 126 participants, and I will continue recruiting until that number is reached. Because authors seemed to be recruiting on an ongoing basis they stopped recruitment when they felt all 120 spots would be filled, but this recruitment will occur through a short period of time and will therefore continue until all 126 participants take the surveys. No preselction criteria or demographics indicated other than being an adult. However, in order to account for the difference sources in sampling, i.e. college campus in original study vs. Mturk in my study, I will incorporate a demographic variable to explore whether this poses a difference. Further, because this study was on Mturk, I restricted my sample to those who are in the US. 

###Materials

Prompts will be followed exactly.

###Procedure	

Exact procedure will be followed: 

"As a cover story, participants were first informed that
the study was being conducted with human-resourcesmanagement
researchers at the (Stanford Graduate School of Business). Participants were told that the
main goal was to understand how people make decisions
about employees. At this point, participants received information
that was ostensibly about an actual employee. This
information differed according to whether they were in the
ambivalent or in the univalent condition.
After reading the employee’s profile, participants were
assigned to the power induction, which involved the most
commonly used procedure for priming differences in perceived
power—writing about a previous episode in which
they had high or low power (Galinsky et al., 2003). Participants
were then asked to indicate the extent to which they
would prefer to wait to make a decision about the
employee (i.e., preference for inaction). Regardless of their
preference, they were subsequently prompted to make a
promote-or-not decision (Experiment 1) or a fire-or-not
decision (Experiment 2) about the employee, and the time
to make this decision was recorded." It is noteworthy that in this study, verbal inaction, the extent to which they wish to wait before making a decision about Bob, is measured through our paradigm in an online setting. Further, behavioral inaction, the length of time participants take to actually make a decision, will be measured by assessing the amount of time they spend on the webpage in which they much make a decision about Bob. 

Participants are also prompted to respond to three questions measuring 
their subjective ambivalence. This will be used as a manipulation check that was also used in the original study. 

The only difference in this replication will be in that participants will only be given the positive attributes of Bob as a univalent case, i.e. experiment 1, insteading of reading both positive and negative attributes. 

###Analysis Plan

1) Data exclusion: participants who fall outside of 6 median absolute deviation from the median of response time will be excluded. Also, participants who have missing data in terms of their behavioral inaction, i.e. length of time they take to choose whether to promote Bob, will be excluded. Behavioral inaction is measured through number of seconds they take to click on the appropriate choice and click next, but those who do not make a choice and only click next will be excluded because their choice based on their ambivalence is unclear. 

2) Manipulation checks will be conducted to ensure that ambivalence is only being invoked by whether participants read an ambivalent vs. univalent description of Bob and not other variables. As such, respondents will be instructed to respond to three questions measuring their ambivalence towards Bob. This will create a composite subjective meaasure of ambivalence. This subjective score will be introduced to a 2x2 (ambivalence vs. univalence) x (powerful vs. powerless) ANOVA to assess whether ambivalence state is in fact the only variable impacting participant responses to their subjective measure of ambivalence. 

3) Multivariate analysis of inaction: responses will be put into a 2x2 MANOVA to assess main effects and interactions effects of employee profile (IV) and power state (IV) on the two measures of inaction (DVs). As such, the outcome of interest in the MANOVA is the interaction between the two IVs on the DVs.   
4) While not included in original study, I will look into education as a covariate. To do so, I will inquire about participants' level of completed education to explore any potential significant differences between the original findings and our findings solely due to the differences in this demographic. This will be introduced to a 3X3 between subject factorial design, though due to our small power, even if an effect exists it will be highly unlikely that we will be able to pick it up.  

Key analysis of interest will be a 2x2 between-subject factorial design - MANOVA

###Differences from Original Study

Two noteworthy differences exist: 

1) Participants in original study were recruited on a college campus and participated in study in person. This is in contrast to this replication study which will use an online platform and recruit participants from a variety of educational backgrounds, i.e. not all will be college students. I will include a question on my demographics survey to inquire about educational level, but even then geographic region of college could impact results.
2) Original study aggregated experiment 1 and 2 results into one design, which means they did not differentiate between negative and positive univalent prompts. I will only be including positive univalent scripts, though I don't think this will impact results because original study did not report significant differences between positive and negative scripts' impact on decision making process. Further, I will not be including self-report power measures as they were only included in experiment 2. 


### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

Nothing to report in addition to analysis plan above. 

#### Actual Sample

Final recorded data from Mturk included 124 participants who submitted the paradigm. This number is prior to exclusions. Data exclusions included participants outside of 6 median absolute deviations from the median on the behavioral inaction measure and participants who did not make any choice on the question regarding promoting Bob. This brought the sample to 103 participants. Below is a demographic table demonstrating the only demographic data that was recorded in this study, i.e. education. Participants had predominately completed some college but not finished/no degree, with a small minority with a high school degree. No other categories present.

### Confirmatory analysis

1) Manipulation checks - Two way factorial design to assess whether variables other than intended one is responsible for differences, i.e. did reading ambivalent vs. univalent profiles determine ambivalence level or did other variable such as power impact it as well? This is to ensure that participants reading ambivalent scenarios are in fact becoming more ambivalent and other conditions are not responsible. This step was included in the original study and will thus be completed as part of confirmatory analysis.

MC <- aov(Subjective.Ambivalence ~ Power.State*Ambivalence.State, data = Final_filtered)

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Our results indicate a significant main effect of ambivalent condition on the subjective measures of ambivalence such that only the ambivalent condition determined participant responses on the subjective measure. Thus the manipulation checks elucidated this main effect. The results of this replication also indicate a main effect of ambivalence condition p = .01 on our IVs. That is, participants in the ambivalent condition demonstrated higher ambivalence as measured through the verbal and behavioral inaction. However, unlike the original findings, this effect did not significantly interact with the power state. That is, the power condition did not impact the level of ambivalence in our participants and is far from significance. 

This demonstrates that our results did not replicate because our main analysis of interest was in the interaction between ambivalence and power state. The effect of the ambivalent state was expected and therefore its significance does not point to a replication. Further, our boxplots suggest that the behavioral inaction DVs did not even demonstrate a difference between the ambivalent state and respondants on all categories had similar response times. While in the verbal inaction boxplot we can see a notable difference between the ambivalent vs. univalent conditions, again there does not seem to be a difference based on the powerful vs. powerless state. 

### Commentary

To further explore our results, we conducted an ANOVA on each DV. As expected from initial boxplots, only the verbal inaction DV demonstrated a significant main effect of ambivalence state. That is, participants in the ambivalent state reported higher ambivalence on the verbal inaction measure. The behavioral inaction DV did not demonstrate any significant effect. That is, there was no difference between the length of time participants took to make a decision about Bob, regardless of their ambivalence or power state. This may point to the fact that length of time spent on a webpage inquiring about participant decisions was not a robust measure of the extent of their inaction. Many confounders could impact how long respondants spend on this page, which can be impacting the results. This is a potntial limitation of our replication paradigm. A second noteworthy limitation is in the use of writing about a powerful moment as a way of evoking a sense of power. Evoking a robust sense of powerfulness is already difficult in in-lab settings where participants may spend more time thinking about this topic, let alone on an online platform. This may speak to the non-replicability of our results. While we do not have a subjective measure of their power state, participants most likely did not experience a shift in how powerful or powerless they felt prior to responding to our DVs. This may speak to limitations in attempting to evoke a state of mind through a short online survey. Finally, we explored one potential moderator of our findings by inquiring about education levels. Since the original study only included undergraduate students and our study was open to all adults, we included education level as a potential covariate.

However, including education in our MANOVA did not demonstrate any significant interaction, though ambivalence state continued to be significant. Our education variable demonstrates that most no one in our sample has completed an undergraduate degree, though most people have attended college at some point.
